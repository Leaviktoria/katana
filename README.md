## Tasks

KATANA is a monthly tournament. Whole winning team obtains eternal fame and liberty from the chains of the Matrix. Teams compete against eachother and the one with the highest score wins.

All team members register on [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com) and will practice JavaScript katas. Only katas done in the week of the tournament do count. Each team member has a score.
