			<h1>We are the FALAFEL WARRIORS.</h1>

			<section>
				We are passionate about good homemade falafel and writing high quality
				code. In our free time, we fight our way through the toughest battles
				and defeat our mortal enemy, Daniel and Attila. You might know us from
				TV-shows like "Jamies Kitchen" and from various podcasts. We also won
				the olympics twice.

			<h1>This week was brutal!</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Tuesday: We gathered in the group created by the random Viki
					generator. Then, we discussed how to create the most epic website you
					have ever seen.
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>
					Thursday: We started executing our plan - we even had a professional
					logo creator who hand-crafted the beautiful FALAFEL WARRIOR logo for
					us.
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>
					Saturday: We added some final touches to our project and prepared
					ourselves mentally to face our enemy.
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>
					During the rest of the week: We used every free second to solve
					katanas and get the maximum score.
