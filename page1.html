					We are passionate about good homemade falafel and writing high quality
					code. In our free time, we fight our way through the toughest battles
					and defeat our mortal enemy, Daniel and Attila. You might know us from
					TV-shows like "Jamies Kitchen" and from various podcasts. We also won
					the olympics twice.</span

					<li>
						Tuesday: We gathered in the group created by the random Viki
						generator. Then, we discussed how to create the most epic website
						you have ever seen.
					</li>
					<br />
					<li>
						Thursday: We started executing our plan - we even had a professional
						logo creator who hand-crafted the beautiful FALAFEL WARRIOR logo for
						us.
					</li>
					<br />
					<li>
						Saturday: We added some final touches to our project and prepared
						ourselves mentally to face our enemy.
					</li>
					<br />
					<li>
						During the rest of the week: We used every free second to solve
						katanas and get the maximum score.
